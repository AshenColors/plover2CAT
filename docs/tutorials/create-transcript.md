# Create New Transcript

`Plover2CAT` should be installed installed (see [previous tutorial](install-plover2cat.md)) for this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new transcript in Plover2CAT.

You will notice that even if you put the cursor into the editor area and enable Plover, nothing is written. A transcript folder has to be created first before writing.

## Create transcript folder

Click on **File > New** in the menu.

## Select location for transcript

A file dialog will appear. You will be allowed to select an existing folder from your filesystem or you can create a new folder.

Upon pressing `Select Folder`, a folder named `transcript-TIMESTAMP` will be created (`TIMESTAMP` is the date and time of creation) in the selected folder.
