# How to write even when window is not in focus

By default, Plover2CAT only will write into the editor if the editor window is in focus. To enable writing even when not in focus, essentially capturing all output from Plover, go to `Steno Actions` menu and then click `Capture All Steno Output`. To restore default behaviour, click it again.
