# How to play, pause and stop audiovisual files

When an existing media file is selected, the file location will show up in the audio control dock. 

To play this file, go to the `Audiovisual` menu and then click `Play/Pause`. This is also available as a button on the toolbar. One press will start playing, and a second press will pause. `Stop` is also located under the `Audiovisual` menu and on the toolbar.
