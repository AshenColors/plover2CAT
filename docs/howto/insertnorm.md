# How to insert normal text 

By default, Plover2CAT only allows writing through Plover to the editor, and not by the QWERTY keyboard. To insert normal text, click `Insert Normal Text` under the `Edit` menu. This will bring up a dialog window with a place to input text. This input accepts QWERTY keyboard input and also text from copying. 

When `OK` is pressed, the text in the input will be inserted into the editor at the cursor position. 

This function can also be triggered by the `Insert` key.
