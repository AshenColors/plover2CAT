# How to scan for last untranslated and add outline to dictionary

**Define Last** is located under the **Steno Actions** menu and on the toolbar.

**Define Last** functions similarly to [**Retroactive Define**](retrodefine.md) in that it adds a new outline to the transcript dictionary. However, with **Define Last**, the editor scans back from the cursor position. If there is a text string that appears to be an untranslated steno chord (letters in steno order and 3 or more characters long), this possible untrans is selected. 

If an untrans is detected, a dialog window will appear for the user to input a translation. Once the user presses `OK`, all occurrences of the untrans in the document is replaced and the new outline added to the transcript dictionary.
