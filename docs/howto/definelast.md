# How to scan for last untranslated and add outline to dictionary

`Define Last` is located under the `Steno Actions` menu and on the toolbar.

`Define Last` functions similarly to [`Retroactive Define`](retrodefine.md) in that it will add a new outline to the transcript dictionary. However, with `Define Last`, the editor will scan back from the cursor position. If there is a text string that appears to be an untranslated steno chord (letters in steno order and 3 or more characters long), this possible untrans will be selected. 

A dialog window will appear for the user to input a translation. Once the user presses `OK`, all occurrences of the untrans in the document will be replaced and the new outline added to the transcript dictionary.
