# How to write only to end of document

By default, Plover2CAT will write to the position of the cursor, inserting text between other text if necessary. To disable this behaviour and only write to the end of the document, regardless of cursor possible, go to `Steno Actions` and click on `Lock Cursor at End`. If the lock icon has a darker background, it means this is enable.

To restore default behaviour, click `Lock Cursor at End` at end again.
