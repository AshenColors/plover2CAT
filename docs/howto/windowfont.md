# How to set the window font

It is possible to set the font for text in the window. Go to `View`, and then `Window Font`.

There will then be a dialog window to select font family, size, and other font effects. Click to confirm the settings.

The font will be applied to all text *except for* 1) the text in the editor and 2) the text in the Paper Tape dock. The former's text is determined by style settings, and the latter is not user-customizable.

The font selection will be saved and maintained across sessions.
