# How to merge paragraphs

`Merge Paragraphs` is located under the `Steno Actions` menu, and also on the toolbar.

Select text or place cursor in the *second* of the paragraphs for the merge. This paragraph will be appended to the previous paragraph. By default, an empty space is added between the two paragraphs. 

Alternatively with the keyboard, set the cursor to the beginning of the second paragraph and stroke to have Plover send a backspace (but a space will not be added inbetween in this case).
