# How to merge paragraphs

**Merge Paragraphs** is located under the **Steno Actions** menu, and as a shortcut on the toolbar.

Select text or place cursor in the *second* of the paragraphs for the merge. This paragraph will be appended to the previous paragraph. Then click **Merge Paragraphs**. 

Based on the Plover configuration for adding space, an empty space may be added between the two paragraphs. 

Alternatively with the keyboard, set the cursor to the beginning of the second paragraph and stroke to have Plover send a backspace (but a space will not be added inbetween in this case).
