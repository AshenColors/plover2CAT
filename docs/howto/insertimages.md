# Insert images

Images are supported in the Plover2CAT editor and for select export formats. In unsupported export formats, the image will be represente by the object replacement character.

To insert an image, first place the cursor at the position for insertion. Navigate to the `Edit` menu and click on `Insert Image`. This will bring up the file selector dialog. Click `OK` to confirm selection for insertion. A copy of the image will be created in the `assets` folder.

Depending on the image's size, it may skew text and paragraph formatting. The image can be deleted through backspace like any ordinary character, and also cut/copy/pasted in the transcript.
