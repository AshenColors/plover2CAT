# How to set max characters per line and max lines per page

`Max char per line` sets the maximum characters allowed per line. Each line will have *at most* this number of characters (excluding timestamps and line numbers).

`Max lines per page` sets the maximum number of text lines allowed per page.  Each page will have *at most* this number of lines. Depending on line spacing settings for styles, pages may have less than this number of lines.

Both controls are found in the `Page Layout` page in the `Toolbox` dock. Both `max char per line` and `max lines per page` can have an `automatic value` if the number is set to zero. In this case, it is up to the editor to automatically fit text content based on page layout and the style properties.
