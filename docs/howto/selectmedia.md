# How to select media file to play

Plover2CAT is able to play common audio and video file formats. Go to `Audiovisual` and then `Open Audiovisual` to get a file dialog and select the media to play.

When a file is selected, the Audio Control Dock will have the location of the audio file displayed above the controls.
