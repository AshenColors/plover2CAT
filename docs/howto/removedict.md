# How to remove a transcript dictionary

Plover2CAT keeps track of the transcript dictionary (`dict/default.json`) and all other added custom dictionaries. 

The editor will load all added dictionaries into Plover when the transcript is opened. To remove a dictionary, use `Remove Transcript Dict` under the `Dictionary` menu. 

A file dialog will open in the transcript's dictionaries directory for selection of a dictionary to remove. This will prevent Plover2CAT from loading the removed dictionary the next time.
