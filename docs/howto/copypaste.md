# How to perform cut, copy, paste and normal copy in the editor

To keep steno data attached to text, Plover2CAT provides steno-aware cut, copy and paste functions. They have some differences compared to normal cutting/copying/pasting functions.

To copy text and the underlying steno data, highlight the desired text and press `Copy` under the `Edit` menu. This will only function if the selection is within the same paragraph, not across paragraphs. It is the same process with cutting text. Select text across paragraphs will not do anything.

To paste, place the cursor at the desired position for insertion and then press `Paste` under the `Edit` menu. The text will be inserted and the steno data will also be inserted behind the scenes.

`Normal Copy` will copy only the text. This is useful for selecting text within the editor to copy to another application. 

To paste from outside the editor into the editor, see [inserting normal text](insertnorm.md).
