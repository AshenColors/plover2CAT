# How to modifying existing style

Navigate to `Styling` page in `Toolbox` dock.

Move the cursor to a paragraph that has the style to be modified. Otherwise, create a paragraph with that style first. 

Properties of the style that can be modified are:

- font family (select from dropdown menu)
- font size (measured in pt)
- font style (bold, italic, underline can be set together and on their own)
- text alignment (only one of left, center, right and justified alignment can be selected)
- line spacing (measured in % of line height for font)
- text indent for first line (measured in inches relative to paragraph left margin)
- paragraph left, right, top and bottom margins (measured in inches)
- paragraph style can be none, or set to another style so that the present style inherits from the parent style
- next style can be set to none, the style itself, or another style so a new paragraph created after the present one will have style set to next style
- heading level, from 1 - 10

To apply and save the changes, press `Modify Style`. Changes to a style will apply document-wide to all paragraphs with the style.
