# Navigate with headings

Navigation will only work if there are paragraphs in the transcript that have styles with a heading level from 1 - 10, which can be set by the user like other style options.

The Navigation dock will show all paragraphs that have a headings level in their style. Each item in the dock will be indented based on their level. The higher the level, the more they are indented.

Double-click on a heading in the navigation dock to move the cursor to the start of that paragraph.
