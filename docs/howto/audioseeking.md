# How to skip forward and back in an audiovisual file

`Skip Forward` and `Skip Back` are located under the `Audiovisual` menu. They will skip forward/back in the track by 5 seconds. These functions also have shortcuts so it is possible to control them from the keyboard.

The Audio Control dock also displays the present position along the track as a slider, with the position and duration on either end in `HH:MM:SS` format. Moving the slider by clicking or dragging will cause the track to skip to that position. (This becomes less accurate if the file has a long duration).
