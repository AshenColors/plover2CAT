# How to do spellcheck

The `Spellcheck` page is located in the `Toolbar` dock. To start spellcheck, select the desired dictionary (`en-US` by default) and press search. If there is a mis-spelling, the text will be shown in the `detected` box. A list of candidate corrections will be shown.

To not correct and move on to the next mis-spelling, press `Skip`. 

To not correct and also ignore all other occurrences, use `Ignore All`. This will be remembered for the rest of the session.

If a correction is desired, select a choice from the list, and then press `Change`.
