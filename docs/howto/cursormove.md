# How to move the cursor

The editor cursor can be moved using keyboard shortcuts (which can be defined in Plover with outlines). The most common cursor movements are available.

| Action                   | Key(s)         |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Move left one character  | `Left`         |
| Move right one character | `Right`        |
| Move up one line         | `Up`           |
| Move down one line       | `Down`         |
| Move left one word       | `Ctrl + Left`  |
| Move right one word      | `Ctrl + Right` |
| Beginning of line        | `Home`         |
| Beginning of text        | `Ctrl + Home`  |
| End of line              | `End`          |
| End of text              | `Ctrl + End`   |

Use the `shift` key with other combinations to select text while moving.


Note that if `Lock Cursor at End` is enabled, text is added to the end of the document regardless of whether the user moves the cursor to.
